# cs10-calculator

You can find my custom calculator for my CS 1.0 class under the file "catdogageconverter.py" within this repository. 

# What does this calculator do?

This is a calculator that will ask the user to input both their cat and dog's ages to find out what each animal's approximate age is in human years.

According to Google (and science?), a cat's age in human years is approximately 7 times greater, while a dog's age in human years is approximately 15 times greater.

Based on that information, the calculator is set to multiply the cat's age by 7 and the dog's age by 15.

Both inputs will return the approximate human age equivalent of each animal.
